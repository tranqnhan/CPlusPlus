<li> ANSWERS TO PROBLEMS: </li>
3.1. The three common errors made when writing selection structures are: using compound condition rather than a nested selection structure, reversing the decision outside of the selection structure, and using unnecessary selection structure. <br>
3.2. Using a compound condition and using unnecessary selection can be inefficiet, but they could also produce the correct results. <br>
3.3.

<br>
3.10. A simulation of the three body problem type of program would prove to be difficult to program without loops. <br>
3.11. Switch: Advantage - concise, easy to read. Disadvantage - less versatile. If/else: Advantage - more versatile. Disadvantage - Not as concise, can be error prone. <br>
3.12. A while loop can be use when you do not know how many times the program will run. A do while loop always run the program at least once. <br>
3.13. A browser chess game benefit greatly from a game loop. We can check that while a checkmate haven't been given, the game keep going. <br>
3.14. Infinite loops are considered bad because it can lead to difficult debugging. If a program runs constantly without any checks, it could fill up the memory allocated and crash the program. <br>
